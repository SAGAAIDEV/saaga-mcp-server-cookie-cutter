"""Parallelization decorator for compute-intensive MCP tools.

This decorator enables parallel execution of MCP tools that can benefit
from concurrent processing, such as batch operations, data processing,
or compute-intensive calculations.

Features:
- Automatic parallelization of compatible tools
- Configurable thread/process pool management
- Load balancing across available resources
- Graceful degradation for unsupported operations
- Integration with SAAGA logging and error handling

Usage:
    @parallelize
    def batch_process_tool(items: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Tool implementation that can be parallelized
        return processed_items

This module will be implemented in Phase 2 of the project.
