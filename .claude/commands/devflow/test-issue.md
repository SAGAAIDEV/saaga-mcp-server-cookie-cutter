## Test Current Implementation - Template Development

I'll analyze the changes and run appropriate tests based on what was implemented.

## Grounding References
- **Test Patterns**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/patterns/integration_test_patterns.py` 
- **Unit Tests**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/patterns/unit_test_patterns.py`

### Step 1: Analyze Changes
Review what was modified to determine appropriate test approach.

### Step 2: Run Tests
Based on the implementation type:
- **MCP Tools**: Run integration tests
- **Utilities**: Run unit tests  
- **Template Changes**: Generate test server
- **Documentation**: Verify examples work

### Step 3: Validate
Ensure all tests pass and implementation meets requirements.
