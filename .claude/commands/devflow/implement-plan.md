## Implement Approved Plan - Template Development

I'll now implement the plan that was previously created and approved.

## Prerequisites
This command should only be run after:
1. `/project:devflow/plan-implementation` has been executed
2. You have reviewed and approved the plan

## Grounding References for Implementation
- **Template Patterns**: `.reference/cookiecutter-maintenance.md`
- **MCP Tool Patterns**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/patterns/tool_patterns.py`
- **Integration Tests**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/patterns/integration_test_patterns.py` - REQUIRED for all tools
- **Unit Tests**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/patterns/unit_test_patterns.py` - For decorators and utilities
- **SAAGA Integration**: `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.reference/saaga-mcp-integration.md`
- **Decorator Testing**: Both unit tests (decorator logic) AND integration tests (example tools)

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Review Plan
I'll reference the plan created earlier to ensure alignment.

### Step 2: Implement Changes
Following the approved plan, I'll:
- Create new files as specified
- Modify existing files according to requirements  
- Apply all required patterns and conventions
- Follow grounding references from `.reference/`

### Step 3: Generate Tests
**CRITICAL**: Tests must be created alongside implementation:

**Test Requirements by Component Type:**
- **For MCP Tools**: Create integration tests following `integration_test_patterns.py`
- **For Example Tools**: ALWAYS create integration tests, even if decorator has unit tests
- **For New Decorators**: Create BOTH:
  - Unit tests for the decorator itself
  - Integration tests for any example tools using the decorator
- **For Utilities**: Create unit tests following `unit_test_patterns.py`
- **For Template Changes**: Update test fixtures in `tests/`

**Special Rules:**
- If JIRA mentions "example tools" â†’ MUST create integration tests for those tools
- If implementing OAuth/auth decorators â†’ MUST test the full flow with example tools
- Decorators that modify tool behavior â†’ Need integration tests showing the behavior
- All tests must use patterns from `.reference/patterns/`
- Tests should validate both success and error cases

**Example**: New OAuth decorator requires:
1. Unit test for the decorator logic
2. Integration tests for Reddit/GitHub/etc example tools using the decorator
3. Tests showing token passthrough and error handling

### Step 4: Track Progress
I'll use TodoWrite to track implementation tasks as I complete them.

### Step 5: Verify Implementation
After each major component:
- Ensure code follows patterns
- Check decorator requirements
- Validate async/await usage
- Confirm Context parameter inclusion
- Confirm tests are created and follow patterns

### Step 6: Run Linting and Formatting
Before moving to testing, ensure code quality:
- Run `ruff check .` to find issues
- Run `ruff format .` to fix formatting
- Fix any remaining linting errors
- Ensure all files follow project style

## ðŸ”„ Next Step

After implementation is complete, test the changes:

```
/project:devflow/test-issue
```

This will:
- Analyze what was implemented
- Run appropriate tests
- Validate the implementation meets requirements

**Important**: Don't skip testing! Always verify your implementation works before creating a PR.
