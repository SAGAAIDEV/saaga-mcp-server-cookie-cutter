I'll help you complete the post-merge workflow to ensure your local environment is synchronized and the merged changes are validated.

## Step 1: Sync with Remote Main
Switching to main and pulling latest changes:

!git checkout main
!git pull origin main

Verifying your changes are included:
!git log --oneline -5

## Step 2: Re-run Feature Tests
Re-running the same tests that validated your feature:

!pytest
!ruff check .

## Step 3: Clean Up Feature Branch
Getting the previous branch name and deleting it:

!git branch -d $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{-1})

Cleaning up remote tracking branches:
!git remote prune origin

## Step 4: Update Development Environment
Ensuring dependencies are up to date:

!pip install -e ".[dev]"

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works
Running a final check to ensure the development environment is healthy:

!python -c "import conduit; print('Conduit package imported successfully')"
!pytest --collect-only | head -20

## Summary
Post-merge actions completed! Your local environment is now:
- Synchronized with the latest main branch
- All tests passing
- Feature branch cleaned up
- Dependencies updated

You're ready to start your next feature!

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Now that your feature is merged and environment is clean:

1. **Start a new feature:**
   ```

   ```
   Begin work on your next JIRA issue

2. **List available sites:**

   If you need to check which Atlassian sites are configured

3. **Check JIRA board:**
   - Review your team's backlog
   - Pick up the next priority issue
   - Coordinate with your team on Slack/Teams

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Your development environment is fresh and ready for the next feature!
