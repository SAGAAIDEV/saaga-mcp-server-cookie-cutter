"""SAAGA decorators for MCP tools.

This module provides four key decorators that enhance MCP tools with
exception handling, logging, type conversion, and parallelization capabilities:

- exception_handler: Graceful error handling and recovery
- tool_logger: Comprehensive logging to SQLite database
- type_converter: Runtime type conversion for MCP compatibility
- parallelize: Parallel execution for compute-intensive tools

These decorators are designed to be applied in sequence to MCP tools,
with each decorator providing a specific enhancement to tool functionality.
